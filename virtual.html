          <h3>Leveraging the Virtual School experience from Spring 2020</h3>
          <p>
            Having worked with approximately 75 students and 50 teachers in a
            virtual school environment for three months, my colleagues and I
            continually evaluated and refined our programs to fit the varying
            and changing needs of our students, keeping students successfully
            engaged with their learning and connected with their peers.
            Simultaneously, I was supporting my own children during their
            virtual learning, as well as maintaining channels of communication
            with their dozen or so teachers and administrators.
          </p>
          <h3>Joining with Other Families</h3>
          <p>
            Sharing school responsibilities with a few families may be a
            promising way to support your child through the fall. I can help
            families meet each other, carefully consider all the aspects of
            their plan, and create a clear, written agreement that meets the
            needs of all families. Advice will be given on age-appropriate
            educational expectations for children. I will offer trouble-shooting
            consultations and opportunities for parents to periodically check in
            with each other in a structured way.
          </p>
          <h3>Finding a Tutor</h3>
          <p>
            Are you considering hiring an educator to support your child during
            this time? I have a network of teachers - Elementary, Special
            Education, Middle and High School - that are ready to help your
            family get through this challenging time.
          </p>
          <h3>Making it Work for your Family</h3>
          <p>
            We understand that each family is different and there is no
            one-size-fits-all solution to the challenges of Virtual School. I
            can help you find the right situation for your child and refine your
            program as the school year progresses. An emphasis will be put on
            helping children be as <em>independent as possible</em> and keeping
            them engaged and motivated. An emphasis will be on finding ways for
            children to socialize safely.
